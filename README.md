Welcome to Lua, in Lua!
===================


Hey! I'm glad you've found me. I hope to become a full implementation of the [Lua 5.2.4](http://lua.org/) one day, but more than that, I hope that I can become a useful guide for those who are interested in language implementation.

I grew out of a [month-long sprint](https://github.com/leegao/Lua-SideProjectMonth) from an initiative to complete a side-project within the span of the November of 2015, but I wanted to keep tredding on.
