Let's make an end-to-end parser and lexer generator in Lua. Document the process in http://luatut.com/

Stretch goals:

  1. add in a toy language interpretor or compiler as well into the mix
  2. add in fancy-pants semiring parsing
  3. explore both LL(1) and L(AL)R(1)
  4. explore LL(*) and LR(*)
  5. write my own regular expression
  6. self-host everything within toy language

 Happy Hacking! :D
